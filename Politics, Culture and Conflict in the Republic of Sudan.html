				<p>Every country functions on the relationship of four intangible characteristics: economic activity, political affairs, social solidarity, and environmental sustainability. I entitled this idea as ‘civil elasticity’ simply because each variable is directly associated with human action, and each variable tends to be responsive to any modifications in another. Hence, the political decisions of Omar Al-Bashir have severely impacted the economic activity in Sudan.</p>
<p>After the long and bloody civil war that resulted with the independence of South Sudan in 2011, north Sudan has suffered economically due to a major loss of it oil fields in the southern region (Aljazeera.com, 2014). In attempt to rebuild the economy of Sudan, president Bashir has connected with a wealthy Saudi Arabian business (Acdemocracy.org, 2014) to construct deals of land grabbing, a form of development that consist of foreign investment. The drive behind land grabbing is that Africa is significantly gifted with abundant natural resources from oil production in Sudan to the gold mines in South Africa.</p>
<p>In Sudan, agriculture is responsible for a great deal of the economic activity and not only impacts the economic features of African countries, but is also a part of African culture and lifestyle.Residents in rural areas often rely on their land use to meet their daily needs; which correlates to the argument whether the right to property is equally important as the human right to food, water, opinion, etc. (Poul Wisborg 2013). Here’s a video that shows the impact of political decisions on the economic activity within Sudan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yXqoLBEvu4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yXqoLBEvu4</a></p>
<p>As a result, inflation has been rising along with food prices, and markets are becoming very scarce. “The governments dire need for resources to finance the on-going civil war, and the greed of some of its top officials may have blinded it from seeing the necessity of addressing some major challenges, such as good governance, which are impairing both the success of foreign investment and rural populations’ livelihood opportunities.” (Rottenburg, Gertel and Calkins, 2014)</p>

<p>Land grabs are defined as large scale land purchase or lease for agricultural production by foreign country or investors (GRAIN, 2008). Graham, et al. (2011) defines land grabbing as “taking possession of and/or controlling a scale of land for commercial/industrial agricultural production which is disproportionate in size in comparison to the average land holding in the region.” The food crisis of 2008 has led to some serious concerns about shortages of food in the near future. In this respect many developed countries like China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates (to cite just a few) have growing interests in developing countries, especially in terms of land acquisition which is more often farmlands.</p>
<p>It is assumed, in a perfect scenario that this type of foreign investment benefits the rural poor, including the creation of a potentially significant number of farm and off-farm jobs, development of rural infrastructure, and poverty-reducing improvements such as construction of schools and health posts. Other possible positive spillovers include resources for new agricultural technologies and practices as well as future global price stability and increased production of food crops that could supply local and national consumers in addition to overseas consumers. Ideally, the positive spillovers will take effect only if there is equal distribution of power in a governance structure of democracy and fair representation of citizens in the governing structure of the country. Well, this is not the case in Sudan!</p>
<p>In Sudan, the overall objective of land grab by government is to provide the state with power to reallocate land to investors and loyalists (Eltayeb ElHadary, Obeng-Odoom, 2012). Land resources are one of the sources of conflict in Sudan (Ayoub, 2006; Suliman, 2000) as well as a major source of corruption in the country. Furthermore, the 1990 Land Allocation Act allows the government to pursue policy of land privatization. Besides some data dating back to 2012, I could not access the recent figures with regards to land grabbing in Sudan. This opacity reflects the “transparency” under which the Government of Sudan operates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the following report to have an apercu of the land grab situation in Sudan (P.28-29):</p>
<p>http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/docs/Publications/GLP/GLP_report_01.pdf</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last few years, the Government of Sudan allowed companies from, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, China and South Korea to acquire land in Sudan. Eltayeb ElHadary, Obeng-Odoom, (2012) believe that from 2004 and 2008, “the total of land grabs in Sudan amounted to 4.0 million hectares of land on leases whose average term is fifty years”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pastoralism affected</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under customary tenure arrangements and in the absence of land titles, pastoralists often find themselves marginalized when foreign investors grab land with the blessing of the states. The bargaining power in negotiating these agreements is on the side of the foreign firm, especially when its aspirations are supported by the host state or local elites. Smallholders, including pastoralists, who are being displaced from their land cannot effectively negotiate terms favorable to them when dealing with such powerful national and international actors, nor can they enforce agreements if the foreign investor fails to provide promised jobs or local facilities. Thus, unequal power relations in the land acquisition deals put the livelihoods of those citizens at risk.</p>
<p>As large scale mechanized agriculture expands, grazing land becomes scarce, especially if the farm is on a migratory route used by pastoralists. First the migratory routes becomes smaller and narrower; second the land left is less fertile and overgrazing has made the rangelands less productive (Catley et al, 2013). Because of this, pastoral migratory patterns are under pressure. Their migration routes are increasingly becoming narrower and shorter (Catley et al, 2013). Some pastoralists lose access to traditional animal routes and watering points. Poverty levels in pastoral communities have increased and land use change by pastoralists to agriculture is increasing (Sachedina, 2006). Others have been displaced by drought and famine and migrated to towns. This is leading to a new form of ‘settled’ pastoralism and is contributing to rural-urban migration. Pastoralists in towns are likely to end up in the squatter settlements surrounding urban centers (Baker &amp; Aida, 1995).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Babiker (2011), the failure of the pastoralists to defend their land tenure rights may be explained by their political marginalization and the hijacking of their representative institutions by livestock traders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gadarif region</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gadarif region is home to some of the largest mechanized rain-fed schemes in Sudan. This is mainly due to the fact that mean annual rainfall is sufficient to sustain such production, hence increasing land productivity as well as being able to feed the growing population. In total, the state has around 4.2 million ha of cultivable land at its disposal (Sulieman &amp; Ahmed, 2013). Much of this land was originally mixed savannah-woodland providing grazing lands for pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. However, there is a conspicuous shift from livestock production to crop farming (Sulieman &amp; Ahmed, 2013). The current land tenure system has created a situation of a few large-scale farmers and many small-scale farmers, as well as restricting livestock herders to the marginal areas of the state (Sulieman &amp; Ahmed, 2013). These processes have led pastoral groups towards rapid sedentarization, urbanization and the breakdown of their traditional livelihood system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know how Sudan is conflict-prone. I just have one question that keeps popping up in my mind: How, according to you, will a hungry man react if you kick his plate (food) away and ask him to look for it somewhere else? Pastoralists have been living the same socio-economic and cultural lifestyle for decades in Sudan. That is their way of life. Just a handful of powerful and corrupt elites are however tampering this lifestyle. Small arms are abundant in Sudan: pushed to an extreme, pastoralists will at one point be fed up and retaliate against the oppressive state as much as the SPLM did during the civil war. Corruption is pushing the Sudanese marginalized population into poverty and in too long I fear that there will be another civil war with the marginalized population attempting to overthrow the radical Islamist government.</p>

<p>Although the conflict in Sudan has not ended completely, it has certainly reduced to a smaller extent. The impact of the long-lasting civil war has created a state of humanitarian crisis in Sudan.</p>
<p>Many people across the world, and especially Sudanese citizens themselves, disagree with the political action of the Sudanese government. Earlier this year, two Sudanese activists were detained and deprived of any communication with others. One of these activists was journalist and blogger Taj Aldeen Arjaa (23 years old), and a university lecturer by the name of Sidig Noreen Ali Abdalla (42 yearsold) (Sudantribune.com, 2014).</p>
<p>The conditions in which these activists are experiencing remains uncertain, but the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies has requested the Sudanese authorities to free these prisoners (who were not charged with a crime) and grant them access to their families, lawyers, and any medical assistance if necessary.</p>
<p>Save Darfur is a project of United to End Genocide, the largest activist organization in America dedicated to preventing and ending genocide and mass atrocities worldwide. Their mission to assist the crisis in the Sudan consists of calling on the U.S. government to respond to the controversy and protect the lives of many endangered civilians (Save Darfur, 2013).</p>
<p>Not only has American organizations participated in the activism for Sudan, but even American celebrities who understand there needs to be something done. George Clooney has expressed his strong support for the Sudanese people who deserve a better quality of life. Of course the Sudanese government responded to the in their typical manner by attempting to bomb the area that George Clooney was located in.</p>
<p>“The reason I come is not because I’m a policy guy and not because I’m a soldier and not because I can do anything except get this on TV and in the newspapers,” (Irishexaminer.com, 2014)</p>
<p>Here is a short video clip of George Clooney’s activism within Sudan and his insight on the region: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGLaX6LYoiw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGLaX6LYoiw</a></p>
<p>Digital activism has also become a rising technique of protesting and raising awareness particularly on a global level. Many college students in the city of Khartoum have invaded twitter and other sources of publication, in order to spread their voices and call for help (Book.globaldigitalactivism.org, 2014).</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/twitter-sudan.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-212 size-medium" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/twitter-sudan-300x204.jpg" alt="twitter sudan" width="300" height="204" srcset="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/twitter-sudan-300x204.jpg 300w, https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/twitter-sudan-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/twitter-sudan.jpg 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>These social media campaigns were very effective and consistent. However, the police and security forces used these social media sites to track protest activity and identify the activist that should be arrested (Book.globaldigitalactivism.org, 2014). I have shared some tweets representing the&nbsp;Sudanese online activism, given by Helena Puig Larrauri in here article, <em>Digital Activism in Sudan</em>.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations have used methods of campaigning and media publicity to create powerful images of human rights violations, and stories of injustice. But this doesn’t necessarily create sustained grassroots support, and often demobilizes those who feel powerless and lack a clear sense of effective reactions to abuses. Organizations like Human Rights Education (HRE) are designed to create personal connections and turn bystanders into activists. It is clear that images &nbsp;can be powerful in sending messages of others suffering, but this also creates the gap between knowledge and acknowledgement. The HRE focuses on closing this gap by increasing individual knowledge and leading to activism, because “knowledge alone does not prevent human rights violations, nor does it empower on its own victims, or encourage bystanders to intervene.” (Mihr and Schmitz, 2007)</p>

				<p>Sudan, which is currently under the reign of a tyrant, is a very secluded country. It is not a headline that Al Bashir and his fellow State elites are very repressive of the media and the international community (except for Asian investors, which I will later elaborate on). In my blog post on humanitarian assistance, I highlighted the repressive actions that the State of Sudan has imposed on humanitarian agencies as a protest to Al-Bashir’s ICC warrant for the genocide in Darfur.</p>
<p>Wait!! How did the world come to know about the genocide in Darfur despite the repressiveness of the Islamic regime?</p>
<p>The answer is a transnational activism in the name of Save Darfur, which started in the United States to raise awareness of international organizations and states. For more information about that social movement and its umbrella of organizations please visit: As argued by Brunton (2012), the American public paid little attention to Darfur when the conflict started, except for a few articles on major newspapers such as New York Times. No alarm sounded until a year after the conflicts started and even then there was no visible public response until months afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Transnationalism explained</strong></p>
<p>Transnational activism can be deﬁned as the mobilization around collective claims that are :a) related to transnational/global issues, b) formulated by actors located in more than one country, and c) addressing more than one national government and/or international govern-mental organization or another international actor (Porta &amp; Marchetti, 2007).</p>
<div style="width: 386px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/140901_r25406-1200-630.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="197"><p class="wp-caption-text">http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/140901_r25406-1200-630.jpg</p></div>
<p><strong>Save Darfur coalition</strong></p>
<p>Save Darfur Coalition was founded at the Darfur Emergency Summit at City University of New York Graduate Center in New York City in July, 2004. What began as a meeting organized by the United States Holocaust Museum and American Jewish World Service grew into a network of more than 190 faith-based, advocacy and human rights organizations with more than 1 million activists and hundreds of community groups committed to ending the genocide in Darfur (United to End Genocide, 2012). According to Brunton (2012) “Save Darfur”, as a movement is a representation of a contemporary social phenomenon that takes shape out of the increasingly globalized nature of civil society. Nowadays, with the advent and social media and rapid communication, news are easily spread to the world in just a click. The world is now reduced to a virtual space, which is very beneficial for activism groups to spread the word of their endeavors. Thank you Internet and Globalization: In light of increasing economic, political and cultural interconnectedness, social movements now have the opportunity to generate greater awareness and wider support (Evans, 2008). If it was not for this, Al-Bashir would have done much worst to the ethnic and tribal minorities in Darfur, if not “wipe them all”!</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/PartnerLogosForRelease.gif" alt="" width="500" height="232"><p class="wp-caption-text">http://www.enoughproject.org/files/u105/PartnerLogosForRelease.gif</p></div>
<p>Save Darfur’s speed of formation and the campaign’s size stood out. It managed to overcome the conventional disinterest attached to previous and other ongoing African civil wars among the American and wider western public (. While Amnesty International and other human rights groups spearheaded initial advocacy efforts on Darfur, Save Darfur was responsible for most fervently broadcasting the issue throughout the United States. One of Save Darfur’s greatest achievement is probably the contribution they made to raise awareness on Al-Bashir’s actions that lead his indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC) with genocide (de Waal, 2007). The movement’s use of the term “genocide”, despite controversy surrounding the accuracy of this claim, has been instrumental in adding political pressure due the mounting priority of human rights issues at the global level. The movement was also able to simplify the conflict into terms that were easily understood and relevant to a wide range of individuals and groups throughout the world (Lanz 2009, Brunton 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Double edged Knife</strong></p>
<p>One must not however be too joyful about the work of transnational activism because every action brings about a reaction, as Einstein would argue. In my opinion, Save Darfur has done a good job in raising awareness about the genocide in Darfur. However, this might have spurred much more racial violence as a reprisal from the pro-government Arab militias. Violence have increased after the ICC warrant against Al-Bashir. And as mentioned in my previous posts, humanitarian agencies were “kicked out” of Darfur at one point in time.</p>
<p>The divestment project might have been beneficial in putting pressure on the Sudanese Governement. Some multinational companies have left Sudan since but what happened afterwards was an increased investment from Asian countries notably China which owned 56% of the oil produced in 2009.</p>
<p>The construction of the Merowe dam has displace hundred and thousands of Nubians in Sudan. Any guess who are behind this supposed “developmental project”? Well, China is the main investor. Please read more about the Merowe Dam because more activism are nowadays geared towards such developmental projects that marginalize minority groups and hinder the balance of the eco-system.</p>
<p>Merowe dam info: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merowe_Dam">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merowe_Dam</a></p>
<p><strong>What other activists are doing?</strong></p>
<p>While doing research for this blog post, I came across <a href="http://bashirwatch.org/">http://bashirwatch.org/</a>. This platform is using the internet to track down Omar al-Bashir’s travel out of Sudan in an attempt to help his arrest by signatories of the ICC. Again the power of the internet is an asset for activism. Another activist group, or rather platform that is doing a good job against perilous and ill-fitted developmental projects such as the construction of dams. (More info: http://www.internationalrivers.org/blogs/227/grassroots-protests-against-chinese-dams-in-africa)</p>
<p>In Sudan, local activism is easily shut down by the government. In 2007, security forces killed four, and injured at least 20 people protesting peacefully against the construction of the Kajbar Dam (Radiodabanga.org, 2014). This is why we need more global activism!!</p>

				<p>I find it extremely fascinating and confusing that slavery is practiced throughout Africa; I mean, its kind of disappointing because Africans were originally the ones being enslaved.</p>
<p>In Sudan, the topic of slavery is barely spoken about and people tend to ignore it. The people of Sudan don’t refer to the topic as slavery, but rather know as the trade in “Black Ivory” (Ahmed, 2007). According to Abdel Ghaffar Ahmed, author of <em>Sudanese trade in Black Ivory: Opening Old Wounds</em>, the Sudanese authorities believe that the less said the better, and that the practice of slavery is considered a European sin. Therefore with the case of Sudan, they blame the trade of Black Ivory on the nineteenth century Turco-Egyptian invasion. Although the Sudanese people believe the less said the better, the memories are inevitable. The slavery in Sudan dates back to the year 640 when the Baqt agreement was established, which expressed that the Nubians were to give the Muslim rulers of Egypt 360 slaves every year and other local items in exchange for food supplies, wine, horses, and cloth (Ahmed, 2007). These historic proceedings play a significant role in the continuation and steady flow of slaves subsequent to the International Declaration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Who is being slaved?</strong></p>
<p>The slaves are typically women, children, and men, from Southern Sudan who generally maintain a Christian faith.</p>
<p>These slaves came different places that often require travelling very far distances. Although a great number of slaves were able to reach their destination, many people lost their lives during this migration due to lack of food, water, rest, and the suffering of ambiguous loss. There is no accurate estimation of the number of slaves in Sudan, but previous research studies prove that slavery is certainly existent in Sudan and that thousands of people have been victimized. A large number of slaves came down the Nile River, or across the desert to markets in north and central Sudan. The Shendi market was a location point where non-Sudanese merchants from different places assembled to trade goods, buy slaves, and also to purchase other important commodities such as gold, ivory, spices, medicines, and (Ahmed, 2007).</p>
<p>It seems like the slavery in Sudan has been unrevealed due to the overweighing issue of civil war. However, it is important not to overlook the issue of slavery because in many ways it has a correlation to the racist historic conflict (Sudanupdate.org, 2014). The slavery in Sudan has also remained somewhat remained unrevealed because the government officials of Sudan are denying the issue, and basically allowing it to continue under little exposure. According to the NYtimes in 2002, an international commission led by the United States strongly condemned the Sudanese government for allowing slavery to flourish in this war-wracked country. According to this panel, the government in officials in Sudan would “burn villages, loot cattle, rape and kill civilians, and abduct and enslave men, women and children.” (Nytimes.com, 2014). The president clearly has a different opinion on the current stage of inequality in Sudan:</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>“Freedom is granted for all the people. We are not afraid. We do not prevent the people from expressing their opinions, but rather we listen to them and we want to know their demands and their legitimate aspirations,” –</em>Omar Al-Bashir (Propagandist Magazine, 2014)</p>

				<p style="text-align: center"><em>“… I was a slave. … When I was nine years old, my village was raided by Arab troops in the pay of Khartoum. As we ran into the bush to escape I watched as childhood friends were shot dead and the old and the weak who were unable to run were burned alive in their huts. I was abducted and given to an Arab family as a “gift”. </em><em>My slave master told me that to be treated like a human being, I must do three things: convert to Islam, take an Arab name, and become their son. To give up my identity. Now, nobody can take my identity away.” </em>– <strong>Simon Deng</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is Simon Deng?</strong></p>
<p>Simon Deng is a South-Sudanese Human Rights activist who lives in the United States. He is a native of the Shilluk Kingdom in South Sudan. Deng is a former domestic slave, gifted to a Northern Sudan family as a slave when he was nine years old. Deng somehow managed to flee from Sudan thanks to two men from his tribe whom he met once when he was sent to the market.</p>
<p><strong>Slavery</strong></p>
<p>Before engaging in a discussion about slavery in “modern Sudan”, I want to invite you to view the following videos to back my argument that slavery is still existing in Sudan. There is not enough data available except unofficial ones that account for a rough estimate of the state of “slavery” in Sudan and some other parts of the world. The international community till now has not taken concrete actions against the Government of Sudan, except a warrant issue which is ridiculed by Al Bashir. I wonder whether the lack of data results as a refusal for the world to see that the human race has not evolved in the proper sense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bilad Al-Sudan</strong></p>
<p>Known as “Bilad Al-Sudan” which means “the nations of the blacks”, Sudan has a long tradition of slavery which is rooted in the Arab traditions dating from the Arab invasion back in time. According to Jok (2014), such distinctions have survived for decades and have fueled various forms of oppression of the black south, even during those periods when slavery has not been authorized by the government. When it is authorized, as it is today, slavery then becomes the extreme form of this systemic oppression. When the slave trade developed into corporate enterprise in the nineteenth century, the slave-takers, who were Arabs, articulated distinctions based on race, ethnicity, and religion that marked the black, infidel southerners as indisputably inferior and therefore “natural” slaves. For centuries, Arabs from what is now the north of Sudan routinely raided African villages to the south. In 1983, those raids resumed when the Muslim, Arab-dominated government in Khartoum attempted to impose Sharia law on the largely Christian and animist south. As fighting broke out between north and south, women and children became the spoils of war for both sides, setting off a much-publicized human rights crisis. Some captives are sold as slaves, while others are forced into military service or to work as field laborers (Jok, 2001).</p>

<p><strong>Modern-day slavery: A fruit of Arabization, Islamization and racial discrimination</strong></p>
<p>Slavery was officially abolished in Sudan in 1924. Under article 20 the Sudan Constitution of 1998, which is the basic law of Sudan imparting validity to all other laws, “Every human being shall have the right to life, freedom, safety of person and dignity of honor save by right in accordance with the law and he is free of subjection to slavery, forced labor, humiliation or torture.” In theory, enslavement and related offences could be brought before Sudan’s Constitutional Court to seek a remedy for violations of basic rights and freedoms protected under article.Sudan was under the British empire in 1899 until its independence in the late 50’s. While slavery was officially abolished in all the British colonies in 1833, Sudan took quite a resistance to it. This tells a lot about the Arab culture of slavery whereby dark colored Africans were enslaved because of their supposed racial inferiority to the wider Arab community.</p>
<p>Slavery is said to be officially abolished in Sudan, but the true and sad story is that this severe act of Human Rights violation is still going on strong and being perpetuated even today. Slavery is found today in many parts of the world, including Mauritania, Pakistan, India, Burma, and Saudi Arabia. But Sudan is the only place where chattel slavery is not just surviving but experiencing a great revival. This renascence of the slave trade began in the mid-1980s and resulted directly from an upsurge of Islamism in Sudan at that time, and especially from the Islamist emphasis on the renewal of jihad. After gaining the upper-hand in Khartoum by about 1983, the Islamists’ immediate goal was to transform the multi-ethnic, multi-religious population of Sudan into an Arab-dominated Muslim state, and to do so through jihad. Under Turabi’s powerful influence, the ruler of the time, Ja‘far an-Numayri, declared himself to be (sounding like a caliph of old), the “rightly guided” leader of an Islamic state. Numayri then abrogated the autonomy agreement he had earlier reached with southern Sudan and imposed the Shari‘a on the whole country (Eibner, 1999). <em>Murahhilin</em> (resttlers, mostly Arabs) raiding became yet more widespread and institutionalized following the military coup of 1989 and the coming to power of a junta composed mainly of hardline Islamist army officers headed by an NIF loyalist, General Omar al-Bashir. This seizure of power permitted the NIF, headed by Turabi, to gain complete control of the Sudanese state, something it had failed to do through electoral politics. The NIF’s <em>raison d’être</em> is the Islamization and Arabization of Sudan (and the rest of Africa) by means of jihad. For the first time since the nineteenth century, slavery in Sudan has become an instrument of a state-sponsored jihad.</p>

<p><strong>The role of international actors</strong></p>
<p>Slavery is still considered a common practice in Sudan. Though there are no official figures, it is estimated that around 1000 people are being abducted every year and that in total 200 000 people are in a state of “slavery” (U.S. Department of State, 2002). International instances such as the UN have kept a long silence on the current violations of Human Rights in Sudan and to date no actions have been taken to eliminate slavery in the country. “Ex-Slave” and Human Rights activist Simon Deng has also pleaded to the US President to take actions to remediate the situation. Please refer to the following link for more details: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-robinson/human-rights-activist-cal_b_788493.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-robinson/human-rights-activist-cal_b_788493.html</a>.</p>
<p>Simon Deng has been very active since the past ten years to fight for the rights of the oppressed Dinkas against the surge of radical Islam and Arabization in the Republic of Sudan, most specifically in the Darfur region. Please refer to: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/diane-bederman/slavery-africa_b_3975881.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/diane-bederman/slavery-africa_b_3975881.html</a> for more details. As argued by the author, international instances such as the UN are blindfolded and “refuse” to see and acknowledge the atrocities committed in Sudan; worse – they are not taking any actions!</p>
<p>Christian Solidarity International (CSI) a Swiss Human Rights organization has been very active since 1995 in liberating slaves. It is one of the few organizations that have helped to liberate “slaves” in Sudan: It has supposedly liberated 80, 000 people since 1995 (Csi-usa.org, 2014). CSI pays roughly $60 to slave owners to liberate the people. But yet this method has been contested because it encourages slavery: because slave owners know they can still sell the slaves and there is a source of money through CSI. Well, criticizing is good but at least CSI had the guts to take action instead of pondering on the best way to free those human beings!</p>
<p>The purpose of writing this post today is to urge for more repressive actions against Al Bashir and the Republic of Sudan for atrocities committed on Human Beings. The UN is blindfolded and the wider international community (Government/States in the G8) are not doing anything. How many Simon Deng do we need to open their eyes? How many CSI do we need to urge for actions?</p>

<p>In the past couple of decades, the Republic of Sudan has really made a strong expression regarding their religious beliefs; maybe even a little too much by cutting ties with the Christians of South Sudan.</p>
<p>Diversity is the essence of society, at least here in America, because its obvious that is not the case in Sudan under the dictatorship of Omar Al-Bashir and previous rulers. See this is the issue with the Sudan we have rulers instead of leaders. <a href="http://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/ruler-bash-head.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-191 size-medium" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/ruler-bash-head-300x180.jpg" alt="President Omar Hassan al-Bashir addresses a crowd in North Khartoum" width="300" height="180" srcset="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/ruler-bash-head-300x180.jpg 300w, https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/ruler-bash-head.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>Rulers are those who take complete advantage of their power of authority and only impose their beliefs, whereas a leader is simply someone who leads the way to a better future by understanding the problems and searching for solutions.</p>
<p>Global Islam has really reached extreme heights, in the sense that Muslims are killing other Muslims and holding hostages in order to conquer power; and more importantly the Muslim ideology that the West is evil. I’m speaking from personal knowledge of being Sudanese, and Muslim, and having grown up in the United States.</p>
<p>Basically in the Islamic world it comes down to choosing sides, and Omar Bashir has chosen Sudan to be a Muslim state. In March 1980, Bashir declared an open door for all “Arab brothers” meaning that no Arab would need a visa to enter Sudan. Members of the Muslim brotherhood and other national &amp; international Islamist groups from Egypt, Eritrea, Algeria, Tunisia, and Uganda migrated to Sudan to escape harassment or arrest in the native country. In the early 1990’s one of those refugees happened to be Osama Bin Laden, who fled from Saudi Arabia where he was under house arrest for condemning his governments role in the Persian Gulf War. This gave the United States suspicion, which is why Sudan was put on the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993. “By 1993 the whole world was aware of Sudan’s links to terrorism. In February, terrorists had driven a rental truck full of explosives into the garage of the World Trade Center in New York City and detonated a bomb that killed five people and injured more then one thousand. Five of the fifteen men indicted in connection with the bombing were Sudanese citizens” (Google Books, 2014).</p>
<p>These historic facts of Sudan have given the country a poor image, and It frustrates me because this is a clear example of a ruler who is not invested in the people of his country. The incident of Meriam Ibrahim (Press, 2014) <a href="http://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/sharia-law-islam-640.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-193 size-medium" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/sharia-law-islam-640-300x200.jpg" alt="sharia-law-islam-640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/sharia-law-islam-640-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/11/sharia-law-islam-640.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>sparked global controversy and was a brief exposure of Al-Bashir’s poor decision-making. Religious beliefs should be handled separately from politics and democracy, his faith in Islam should not be empowered on the way people live their lives. Although history appears problematic, Sudan has made significant effort to improve their global image and to better the Sudanese-American relation. According to the SudanNow magazine&nbsp;“The Sudanese government has taken steps to limit the activities of foreign terrorist groups within Sudan and has worked hard to disrupt foreign fighters’ use of Sudan as a logistics base and transit point for violent extremists going to Iraq and that Sudan was generally responsive to the international community’s concerns on terrorism and was generally supportive of international counterterrorism efforts” (Agency, 2011)</p>

				<p>Throughout this post I will demonstrate how the adoption of radical Islam has led to the rise and continuation of conflict. The delusionary stance of the Sudanese government to Arabize the country as a method to maintain totalitarian power have contributed to the Darfur genocide. The Arabization of the country has also been a pretext for the government to engage into conflict and “milk resources” from the region and from the fellow Arab networks.</p>
<p>The largest religion in Sudan is Islam and institutional and political governance power has historically been in the hands of Muslims. According to UNDP Sudan, the Muslim population is 97%, including numerous Arab and non-Arab groups. The remaining 3% ascribe to either Christianity or traditional animist religions. Islamization of Sudan began in the eighth century (please refer to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_the_Sudan_region">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_the_Sudan_region</a>).</p>
<p>While Islam is the dominant religion, Sudan also comprises of other ethno-religious minorities such as Christianity. The long standing war between Sudan and their Southern ‘brothers’ was a result of oppression of an Islamic state against religious and ethnic minorities which ended into rebellion of the latter. The story that everyone knows now is that now we have Sudan, with a majority of Muslims and Southern Sudan with a larger composition of Christians. However, the long standing civil war in Sudan and the formation of the Sudan People Liberation Army was ignited as a counter measure to the Islamization and Arabization project that was very and is still prominent today. The Islamization project endeavors to set up political Islam as the main governance strategy for the country and the application of the Sharia Law. Political Islam is part of a broad intellectual, cultural, social, and political movement throughout the Islamic world. The movement is often referred to and called Islamic Resurgence or Islamic Revival, and political Islam is only one component of the greater resurgence and revival of Islamic ideas, practices, and rhetoric. Ayoob (2008) considers political Islam as a political ideology adopting the principles of Islam. Giving a more comprehensive definition, Denoeux (2002) argues that political Islam is a form of instrumentalization of Islam by individuals, groups and organizations that pursue political objectives. It provides political responses to today’s societal challenges by imagining a future, the foundations for which rest on re-appropriated, reinvented concepts borrowed from the Islamic tradition”.</p>
<p><strong>Islamization of Sudan and the surge of conflict.</strong></p>
<p>Political Islam in the Sudan goes back to the establishment of the Mahdist state (1885-1898) in last decades of the 18th century. After the colonial period between 1898-1855, Islamist focused their aspirations on the drafting of an ‘Islamic Constitution’, and saw this as the primary means to rid the country of secular ideas (Makris, 2006). Their efforts met resistance from liberals and the large non-Muslim minority, among other things because the Islamist discourse was seen as couching racial stereotypes and delegitimizing dissent. In 1983 the then President Numairy Islamized the legal system thus effectively creating an Islamic state (Makris, 2006). This contributed to reigniting the civil war that had ended in 1972 with the signing of the Addis Ababa Peace Agreement. In 1989 a military coup by a group of officers belonging to the Islamist movement heralded a period of radical Islamization of the society. By this time, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement had emerged as the most articulate opposition of the Islamist project, and it promoted its own secular ideology (Makris, 2006). The civil war became as much a ‘war of visions’ as a struggle for political and economic control.</p>
<p><strong>The Arabization of Sudan and Conflict</strong></p>
<p>The Government centrally based in Khartoum is politically dominated by Arab elites. Being a member of the National Congress Party (formerly known as the National Islamic Front), Al Bashir has been in contact with radical Islamists such as Al Tourabi in his early years as the head of state. According to Quach (2004) Khartoum constantly rages war to maintain and expand central control over Sudan peripherals and to exploit resources and amass wealth for the central government. Because Khartoum is heavily dependent on outside resources to run its governing machine, absolute control over the country is critical to achieve its exploitation strategy. The vampire junta not only manipulates its Arab network to recruit resources but also use Arab militias throughout the country as a proxy to destabilize the status and development of its oppositions. . Creating its own war-torn conditions, the state also “relied on kindness and intentions of outside powers” to ‘milk’ foreign assistance and investment (Hoagland, 2004). The conflict in Darfur is a pretense for the central power, namely Al Bashir, to maintain central power by the divide and rule and to use the “funds” provided by such war in terms of foreign assistance. According to Quach (2004), in order to preserve Arab supremacy and maximize the ‘milking’ of regional resources, the Arab clientelistic network promotes divisions along ethnic lines in Sudanese society to carry out the Khartoum ‘divide and rule’ strategy. It has become an appendage to assist Khartoum predatory rulers in strengthening its grip on the region. Darfur violence was triggered by a rebellious movement but was precipitated and is exacerbated by the predatory state’s policy to expand and exert absolute power over the peripherals. That policy paved the way for the Arab militias to begin the genocidal campaign against African opposition in Sudan in general and in Darfur in this particular case.</p>
<p><strong>The political game ending in a genocide</strong></p>
<p>Although Arabs and Africans have intermingled and their religions do not play a primary role in the Darfur conflict, the Arab-led government uses the Arab-ethnocentric policy – which dictates superiority and supremacy of the Arab race in Sudan – and manipulates Islamist ideology to deepen the ethnic division. Under this policy and ideology, Arab leadership is considered “untouchable” (Quach, 2004).</p>
<p>Armed by the elites, the Arab militias ended up going for a genocide, attacking ethnic minorities in the Darfur region; the same ethnic cleansing backed by Al Bashir which led to the warrant issue by the ICC. The state of human rights in Darfur has been violated by the atrocities of the Arab militias: rape, robbery, torture, kidnapping and killing!</p>

<p>The following is an extract of an interview carried out by Emily Wax for Washington Post, June 30, 2004:</p>
<p><em>At first light on Sunday, three young women walked into a scrubby field just outside their refugee camp in West Darfur. They had gone out to collect straw for their family’s donkeys. They recalled thinking that the Arab militiamen who were attacking African tribes at night would still be asleep. But six men grabbed them, yelling Arabic slurs such as “zurga” and “abid,” meaning “black” and “slave.” Then the men raped them, beat them and left them on the ground, they said. </em></p>
<p><em>“They grabbed my donkey and my straw and said, ‘Black girl, you are too dark. You are like a dog. We want to make a light baby,’ ” said Sawela Suliman, 22, showing slashes from where a whip had struck her thighs as her father held up a police and health report with details of the attack. “They said, ‘You get out of this area and leave the child when it’s made.’ ” </em></p>
<p><em>Suliman’s father, a tall, proud man dressed in a flowing white robe, cried as she described the rape. It was not an isolated incident, according to human rights officials and aid workers in this region of western Sudan, where 1.2 million Africans have been driven from their lands by government-backed Arab militias, tribal fighters known as Janjaweed. </em></p>
<p>As argued earlier, the Sudanese elite have used their Arab/Islamic network as sources of fund and man power. While well aware of the atrocities committed in the region of Darfur, the Sudanese government has had a continued support of the network.</p>

<p>“Human security demands protection from the risks of daily insecurities, from violence and disease to inadequate access to water or sanitation that each can reverse human development achievements.”<span style="color: #666666">(Anon, 2014)</span></p>
<p>In this modern era of globalization and international integration, human security has become a major global concern for protecting the lives of those suffering extremely unconditional living situations.</p>
<p>Sudan has struggled to maintain adequate human security due to the recent civil war that has resulted in many displaced people within the country and internationally. The national government of north Sudan has lacked to provide security for these displaced people who are primarily from Southern Sudan because the government was a rival of the rebels from Southern Sudan. According to the NY times, “the protection and safety of civilians has never been a priority for the N.C.P. during its 22 years in power. This was evident in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094995">civil war</a> against South Sudan and the <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">ongoing conflict in Darfur</a>. Unless the Obama administration and the international community are committed to finding an all-encompassing political solution to this new conflict (and Sudan’s many other issues) and to impose further economic sanctions, Sudan is likely to be at the threshold of yet another long-term war”<span style="color: #666666">(Nytimes.com, 2014)</span>.<a href="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/hs-1.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-170 size-full" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/hs-1.jpg" alt="hs 1" width="275" height="183"></a></p>
<p>In terms of responsibility, I believe every national government plays the biggest role of protecting the human security of their citizens but the citizens themselves, organizations, and companies, all have responsibilities because human security links individual rights and state sovereignty in a way that reverses the hierarchy of sovereignty over individual rights in traditional international law. Whereas state sovereignty and human rights were viewed as incompatible, human security advocates argue it necessary to redefine sovereignty to mean an ethical responsibility to defend and protect the vital interests of all human beings (MacLean, Black and Shaw, 2006).</p>
<p>However, there are a number of current organizations working to control the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. The “Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) is a UN ‘umbrella’ organization, to provide the diplomatic cover and operational support to allow long term humanitarian and emergency food aid to both the government and the rebel sides in the long-running south Sudanese civil war. Over the years, the destruction of infrastructure in the country has meant that the provision of basic health care has been seriously hampered” (Taylor-Robinson, 2002). Furthermore, since human security applies to all human beings, it should be a priority of each individual to improve the quality of life all around the world. Dalia Haj Omar is a human rights activist from Sudan, <a href="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/dalia-haj-omar.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-169 size-full" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/dalia-haj-omar.jpg" alt="dalia haj omar" width="100" height="100"></a>who is fighting to bring peace within Sudan by leading grassroots movements and empowering the people to earn what they deserve.</p>

<p>As a Sudanese-American, I am inspired to return to Sudan and provide as much assistance as possible. My family was involved in the diaspora but since my family is from north Sudan, we experienced a different migration in which my father was pursuing his education in America. In my opinion, transnationalism is meaningful if the individual(s) who experienced international migration return to their country of origin and help build a better future. Therefore, once I graduate I am strongly determined to go back to Sudan and apply all the knowledge I have learned in my studies, and hopefully make a positive difference in the living conditions.<a href="http://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/10/human-security.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174 size-medium" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/human-security-300x183.png" alt="human security" width="300" height="183" srcset="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/10/human-security-300x183.png 300w, https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/10/human-security-1024x627.png 1024w, https://wordpress.clarku.edu/id252-sudan/files/2014/10/human-security.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>

				<p>As my previous blog posts pointed out, there has been a severe humanitarian crisis in the region of Darfur. Characterized by ethnic tensions and perpetrated violence from pro-government militias and rebel groups, the crisis in Darfur has attracted a load of attention from the international community, especially humanitarian aid agencies. The humanitarian operations there have in fact been characterized as one of the largest in the world (OCHA 2009). For example, between 2003 and 2009, total US humanitarian assistance to Darfur was estimated to be over US$250million (Okeke, 2011). In my blog post dated October 6, I mentioned the following:</p>
<p><em>“The Sudanese government is widely accused of arming militias drawn from Arab tribes who have used scorched-earth tactics against the rebels’ communities. Khartoum has denied the accusations, but however, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, describing the Janjaweed as allies of the Sudanese armed forces. After this warrant issue in 2009, the government expelled 13 international agencies from Sudan and three local agencies from Darfur (Trust.org, 2014).”</em></p>
<p>According to Ali Al-Zaatari, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Sudan, writing on Sudan Vision:</p>
<p><em>There is an inescapable ethical and moral obligation to the 6.9 million people in Sudan (20 percent of the population) that are in need of humanitarian aid in 2014 according to estimates of UN agencies, international humanitarian organizations and the Government of Sudan. The number of affected people increased in January 2014 by 800,000 people surpassing the initial estimates in the Sudan Strategic Response Plan for 2014 that put the number of affected people at 6.1 million. This increase is a result of: (i) the armed conflict in the states of Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile where UN agencies are unable to access affected people in areas suffering insecurity or are under the control of the opposition to assess the humanitarian situation, and (ii) the influx of South Sudan refugees who fled the civil war that started end of last year.&nbsp; These people cannot be abandoned. Malnutrition rates range from 15 percent to 28.2 percent and reach 42 percent in some areas. It is Sudan’s legal and sovereign obligation to fend for its people, but it is equally the international community’s moral obligation to aid people in desperate humanitarian need, and to prompt Sudan to do so as well.</em>Everything mentioned above spill the urgency of humanitarian aid in the region of Darfur.</p>
<p><strong>However how come that the international agencies and organizations have not been able to protect the civilians in Darfur?</strong></p>
<p><a href="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/index.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165" src="./Politics, Culture and Conflict in the Republic of Sudan_files/index.jpg" alt="index" width="257" height="196"></a></p>
<p>I consider that the humanitarian aid in the Darfur region was inefficient and somehow helped in escalating violence by engaging with rebel and pro-government militias. The politicization of humanitarian aid is the main factor that has led to this situation.</p>
<p>Discourses in the literature of humanitarianism revolve around the politicization of humanitarianism versus “relief” as a-political whereby humanitarian aid should not be influenced by state intervention and other political forces. The clause of “Responsibility to Protect” (R2P) endorsed by the UN (Paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 UN Summit document) has been a major contributor to the discourses of humanitarianism. R2P is a policy framework considered significant to the prevention of, and a response to conflict-related mass atrocities. It is a benchmark for the prevention of and for responses to four conflict-related atrocities, namely genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. According to the current debate, the R2P is a major leap towards the politicization of humanitarianism. The modern international system is founded on the premise that sovereign states have a right to non-intervention, to be free from unwanted external involvement in their internal affairs (Seybolt, 2007). Yet repeated humanitarian interventions since 1991 have confronted the idea of sovereign immunity in the name of protecting civilians from harm. This human security perspective on the use of force, grounded in the belief that the rights of people, not states, are the bedrock of a just and secure world, has found its voice in the concept that states have a responsibility to protect civilians within their jurisdiction (Seybolt, 2007).</p>
<p><strong>Is humanitarianism losing its essence? The case of Sudan and its contribution to the discourses of humanitarianism.</strong></p>
<p>My understanding of humanitarianism and humanitarian aid is the relief provided to a population in danger, and in need of support to protect their lives. It is a neutral position where the only interest of humanitarian assistance is to protect lives and to be a-political. Yet politics has been embedded in humanitarian assistance so far in Sudan. The most profound criticism of humanitarian assistance in Sudan was the Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS). OLS was set up in April 1989 as a direct international humanitarian response to the disasters that stemmed from the civil war between the government of Sudan and the SPLM/A. For more information on OLS: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Lifeline_Sudan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Lifeline_Sudan</a></p>
<p>The various organizations and agencies falling under the umbrella of the OLS have been criticized for complicity in advancing the political and economic agendas of powerful groups in the Sudan, especially the government of Sudan. Specifically, it has been argued that OLS engendered a deeper linkage between relief and broader developmental goals. This led to a dangerous convergence between international aid delivery and the political and economic dominance of the center in the Sudan (Okeke, 2011). In trying to keep a distance from the affairs of state sovereignty, many humanitarian aid was very conducive in building partnership with rebel groups and pro-government militias. Despite their noble intention to save lives, they were the subject of exploitation (in terms of resources) which were turned into the advantages of the factions, thus not reaching the intended population in need. For instance, writing on Sudan Vision journalist Khalid Al Mubarak made an analysis of the OLS, argued that “<em>Operation Lifeline Sudan was used as cover for feeding the SPLA during the second civil war</em>.” Okeke (2011), By 1989, the Sudan had incurred external debt of about US$13billion and faced the twin problems of severe financial crisis, especially because of her expulsion from the World Bank and international isolation, at least from Western governments. Through OLS, the government of Sudan was able to bolster its finances and increase its international legitimacy.</p>
<p>According to Seybolt (2007),the painful events in Darfur, Sudan, are a case in point marking the inefficiency of humanitarian assistance framed by politics. Since 2003 tens of thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes by government-backed militia. I strongly believe that if we want to stick humanitarian aid to the “relief” aspect, aid agencies should keep their boundaries to political forces that mark conflict in a region: stay aside of government and rebel forces and provide the services to the population in need and avoid the 1993 Somalia event.</p>
